# Integrating OpenAI with Azure Functions

This repository serves as a personal project to integrate OpenAI with Azure Functions using an HTTP trigger. It outlines the steps for setting up an Azure Function App and sending requests to OpenAIâ€™s API for tasks such as text summarization and sentiment analysis.

## Purpose

This project is primarily for personal experimentation and learning, focusing on:
- Creating and deploying an Azure Function with an HTTP trigger.
- Interacting with OpenAI's API to process requests and handle responses.
- Exploring the use of different AI models for various tasks.

## Project Breakdown

1. **Creating an Azure Function App for HTTP Trigger via Azure Portal**
   - Step-by-step instructions for setting up the function app in the Azure Portal.

2. **Setting up a Local Visual Studio Code Project with Azure Functions Extension**
   - Configuring your local development environment for Azure Functions using VS Code.

3. **Modifying the Basic Function for OpenAI Integration**
   - Code for integrating with OpenAI's API, handling requests and responses.

4. **Selecting the Right AI Model and Prompt**
   - Guidelines for choosing the appropriate model and formatting prompts.

5. **Adding OpenAI API Key and Logging**
   - How to configure your OpenAI API key and implement logging to track requests.
